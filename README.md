# chatbot-
A chatbot (also known as a talkbots, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.[1] Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.

Project guidelines:

--  set the Java complinace level to 1.8

-- import the formatter file in you IDE so that we can reduce the merge conflicts resulting from different formats.

	The formatter can be found in the develop branch: /develop/formatter.xml

--Please don't use null, or at least reduce the usage of nulls as much as possible that way we can eliminate the most occuring Exception Class -NullPointerException-.
	Here is an article on why you shouldn't use null in your project and how to avoid using it: https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained

--Please use Java 8 lambda experssions and Java 8 streams to manipulate different data structres, here is a tutorial on how to use Lambda experssions in Java 8:
